What is nodejs?
    - basically, it allows you to use js to build a server. It's got some tools that let you connect to the clients side and to the db

- if you type node in the terminal it will open up the Node REPL (Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop) ctrl+d to exit & ctrl+l to clear

After the project was completed, the module went on to talk about npm and I'm going to take notes on that here:

- npm is basically a huge library including a lot of different Nodejs packages.

1. When you start a new project, use "npm init" in the command line to initialize the registry.
2. To install an npm package write in the command line "npm install *package-name*" (you can use "i" as a shorthand for install).
    2.i. To specify a dependency as a dev. dependency, add "--save-dev" at the end of the package name.
3. Use nodemon so you don't have to constantly be ending the server.
    3.i. write in the command line "nodemon *file-name*".

TYPES OF PACKAGES:
    1. Simple Dependencies
        - contain code we use in our own applications.
        - ie: superheroes, supervillains, etc.
    2. Development Dependencies 
        - are tools for development.
        - ie: debugger tools, testing packages, nodemon, etc.
        - our code doesn't really depend on them, they are just used to make a programmer's life easier.
    NOTE: we call these packages dependencies because our code depends on them in order to run.

TYPES OF INSTALLS:
    1. Local install
        - When you install a package and it is only available in the folder/project you installed it in.
    2. Global install
        - You can install a package so that it's available in every directory in a computer.
        - Do this by adding the global flag ("--g") to the end of the install line.

- You can specify a script in the package.json file that gets installed when you run "npm init".
    -> This will basically act like a variable that when you write "npm run *script*" the code you entered as script will run.
    -> Looks like this:
        "scripts": {
            "start": "nodemon index.js"
        }
        -> When you write "npm run start" in the command line, it will run "nodemon index.js" in the background.
            -> "start" is actually something of a default for scripts so in this case you don't have to include "run", you can just write "npm start".
